A horse is a horse of course of course, and no one can talk to a horse of course. That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr. Ed.

Go right to the source and ask the horse, he'll give you an answer that you can endorse. He's always on the steady course. Talk to Mr. Ed.

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip that started on this tropic port aboard this tiny ship.
